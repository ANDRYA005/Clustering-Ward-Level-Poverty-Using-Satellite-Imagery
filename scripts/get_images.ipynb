However, to do this, we need to shift the center of our sampled images slighly lower, as we are removing pixels from only the bottom of the image, even though there are $\\approx 12.5$ pixels at the top of the image that are also being added. Thus, we need to shift the center down \"12.5 pixels\". Converting this to lat/lng values, we get that:\n",
